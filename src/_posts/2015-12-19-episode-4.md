After technical difficulties with the first attempt of this episode, Chris and
Jeff talk about all things streaming media! The long-awaited AppleTV 4 has
finally arrived, and Jeff breaks down why you can't watch your favorite sports
team without jumping through hoops.

Chris used to have a crappy Linksys router, but ended up purchasing the [Apple
AirPort Extreme](http://www.apple.com/airport-extreme/) router. 802.11ac has
multi-station WLAN throughput of at least 1 gigabit per second and a single link
throughput of at least 500 megabits per second.

The AppleTV doesn't have [gigabit ethernet](http://www.apple.com/tv/specs/)

Best new app for the Apple TV? [Plex](https://plex.tv/appletv)

The AppleTV [remote](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205305) is pretty great.

A walk down [TiVo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo_digital_video_recorders)
memory lane.

Jeff prefers to watch The Daily Show on his [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/)
setup because he can skip the commercials... until they added copy protection!

[Copy Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_Control_Information) bits
encrypt the channel streams, and don't let you record without the decryption
key.

[John Oliver](http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver) may have
stolen our hearts. And he posts the long videos [on
youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight) for free!

HBO uses [MLB's streaming
infrastructure](http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9090897/mlb-bam-live-streaming-internet-tv-nhl-hbo-now-espn)

[Andy Samberg](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/20/samberg-hbo-go-password) and
the [HBO
CEO](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattlynley/hbos-ceo-doesnt-care-that-you-are-sharing-your-hbo-password#.vp38XBjjm)
love giving out HBO GO passwords!

To [binge](http://gothamist.com/2016/01/22/netflix_binge_blizzard_guide.php), or
not to binge? That is the question.
