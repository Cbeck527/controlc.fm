Chris and Jeff are back from Montreal Canada where they attended PyCon 2015!
This episode they are joined by two very special guests [Mary
Nagle](https://twitter.com/maryknagle) and [Karina
Runziov](https://twitter.com/kruzinov), two software engineers in the industry.

* We're totally (not) live from [PyCon 2015!](http://us.pycon.org/2015/)

* Our collective favorite, one of the [keynotes by Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE)

* [Guido van Rossum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) the founder
  of the Python programming language doesn't really like [keynote
  speeches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wDvzy6Hgxg)

* Ruby is [really old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29)

* Does Guido do tickets?

* [Running Python without an OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYQ_lq5dcvM)

* David Beazley talks about [Python
  Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4) and the crowd goes
  wild.

* Mary tells us what happens when you [type 'python' and press 
  enter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVhSjZYwZJo)

* Chris learns about the inner workings of python, and his mind is blown

* [Strange behaviors in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH4XF6pKKmk) and
  jumping into the C part of the interpreter

* [Hash functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGwNQfjLTp0), and the best
  ways to use them!

* DOCKERIZE ALL THE THINGS! [Demystifying the mysteries of
  docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVVtR_hrdKI)

* [CoreOS and containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCor69OeR0g) are fun!

* An [empty repository](https://github.com/joetastic/ansible-coreos) for our
  docker and ansible work

* [Python profiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uJWWXYHxaM) for better
  optimizations, and how [mongo and
  node](http://java.dzone.com/articles/mongodb-facts-over-80000) are really fast

* To Python, or not to Python. [That is the
  question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoWG0lavg9U)

* [Strace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v6o-VsLAew) is pretty awesome,
  apparently.

* [pgcli](http://pgcli.com/) is amazing

* Mary loves standup, but only in Canada

* Going to portland next year? Will Jeff do a talk? We shall see!
