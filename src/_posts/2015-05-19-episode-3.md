On the heels of launching his new service, CTO of [Maple](http://www.maple.com) Daniel Cowgill sits down with Chris and Jeff to discuss the tech that went into launching a vertically integrated food delivery service.

* [The website is down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8_Kfjo3VjU)

* The [financial district in Manhattan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Financial+District,+New+York,+NY/@40.7088151,-74.0079341,15z) is the current delivery zone for Maple

* Maple uses [Go](http://golang.org) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org)

* Dan's only prior [restaurant experience](http://www.bravotv.com/top-chef)

* [I don't want to taco 'bout it](http://i.imgur.com/RmoxmQw.jpg)

* Other food delivery companies are trying different spins on delivery. [Sprig](https://www.sprig.com) has surge pricing and [Munchery](https://munchery.com) delivers food cold

* Casper [delivers mattresses by bike messenger in New York City](http://www.buzzfeed.com/iknowkayleen/slumber-party)

* Maple's javascript frontend is using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and some Mithril(https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/) internally

* Deciding how to deliver their food in the most efficient way possible is more complex than just [the travelling salesman problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

* Maple ruled out using [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) early on

* [Leaving node](https://medium.com/code-adventures/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b)

* Go [doesn't have generics](https://golang.org/doc/faq#generics)

* Nginx uses [round-robin for load balancing](http://nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/load-balancer/#method) by default

* Maple is using [Linode](https://www.linode.com) for now
